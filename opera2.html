    <h3>Back After Break</h3>

        Reform has not stopped here—it has been applied
        even to the costume of our people. Discarding their own barbaric
        dress, the natives of our land have unanimously adopted the taste-
        ful fashions of England in all their rich entirety. Scaphio and
        Phantis have undertaken a contract to supply the whole of Utopia
        with clothing designed upon the most approved English
        models—and the first Drawing-Room under the new state of
        things is to be held here this evening.

        But Drawing-Rooms are always held in the afternoon.

        Ah, we've improved upon that. We all look so much
        better by candlelight! And when I tell you, dearest, that my
        Court train has just arrived, you will understand that I am longing
         to go and try it on.

        Then we must part?

        Necessarily, for a time.
