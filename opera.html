    <h3>The Utopia</h3>
    <h4>Act II</h4>

    <p class="speech">
        Why, Arthur, what does it matter? When the higher
        qualities of the heart are all that can be desired, the higher
        notes of the voice are matters of comparative insignificance. Who
        thinks slightingly of the cocoanut because it is husky?
        <span class="direction">(demurely, she puts her hand in his)</span>
        You are not singing for an engagement, you have that already!
    </p>

    <h5 class="name fitz">Fitz.:</h5>
    <p class="speech">
        How good and wise you are! How unerringly your
        practiced brain winnows the wheat from the chaff—the
        material from the merely incidental!
    </p>

    <h5 class="name zara">Zara:</h5>
    <p class="speech">
        My Girton training, Arthur. At Girton all is wheat, and
        idle chaff is never heard within its walls! But tell me, is not
        all working marvelously well? Have not our Flowers of Progress
        more than justified their name?
    </p>

    <h5 class="name fitz">Fitz.:</h5>
    <p class="speech">
        We have indeed done our best. Captain Corcoran and I
        have, in concert, thoroughly remodeled the sister-
        services—and upon so sound a basis that the South Pacific
        trembles at the name of Utopia!
    </p>

    <h5 class="name zara">Zara:</h5>
    <p class="speech">
        How clever of you!
    </p>

    <h5 class="name fitz">Fitz.:</h5>
    <p class="speech">
        Clever? Not a bit. It's easy as possible when the
        Admiralty and Horse Guards are not there to interfere. And so
        with the others. Freed from the trammels imposed upon them by
        idle Acts of Parliament, all have given their natural talents
        full play and introduced reforms which, even in England, were
        never dreamt of!
    </p>

    <h5 class="name zara">Zara:</h5> 
    <p class="speech">
        But perhaps the most beneficent changes of all has been
        effected by Mr. Goldbury, who, discarding the exploded theory
        that some strange magic lies hidden in the number Seven, has
        applied the Limited Liability principle to individuals, and every
        man, woman, and child is now a Company Limited with liability
        restricted to the amount of his declared Capital! There is not a
        christened baby in Utopia who has not already issued his little
        Prospectus!
    </p>

    <h5 class="name fitz">Fitz.:</h5>
    <p class="speech">
        Marvelous is the power of a Civilization which can 
        transmute, by a word, a Limited Income into an Income Limited.
